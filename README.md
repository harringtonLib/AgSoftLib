# AgSoftLibSanitary and Phytosanitary Standards Quarantine Enforcement (SPSQE) Project
                                    ##Introduction
                                    
The SPSQE project aims to develop a comprehensive Border Quarantine Management Information System (BQMIS) and a National Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Laboratory Information Management System (NSPLIMS). These systems are designed to automate the inspection, verification,
and quarantine control of agricultural products, ensuring compliance with international sanitary and phytosanitary standards.

                                  ##Features
Quarantine Inspection Data Collection: Streamline the collection and storage of quarantine inspection data.
Laboratory Sample Management: Facilitate the management of sample lifecycles from reception to analysis and result reporting.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate detailed reports on quarantine activities and laboratory analyses.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker
